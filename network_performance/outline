# Introduction

- Introduction on the purpose and scope of this report.
- Why BITAG is writing it
- Target audience
- Structure of document

# Recap of COVID-19 in 2020 and the Internet
- Discuss here a short recap of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, government ordered shutdowns when they occurred and for how long, how this impacted society with a sudden shift to WFH, distance learnming, social distancing, etc.
- High level observed changes in how the internet was used - more bandwidth, more usage, potential shifts in peak hour, changes in popular applications
- List and cite some of the key reported metrics, observations (e.g. 1 year's worth of bw growth in one month, peak hour shifting from 8pm to 2pm in some markets, etc.)

# Closer Look at How the End-to-End Ecosystem Responded
- Short description of the E2E internet ecosystem and the key actors in this report
Content/Platforms <-+-> Transit/CDNS/Infrastructure <-+-> ISPs <--> Home networks <--> Applications
(Note add here a real diagram)

## Content/Platforms
-- Netflix
-- NBCU
-- Etc.
[ 
- Describe here how the content/platforms responded and why
- How usage was changing (e.g. peak hour, peak traffic, geographic changes, concurrency/household
- Describe actions taken (e.g. scaling up, shifting resource, changing routes, adding CDNs, changing streaming rates, etc.
]

## Transit Providers
-- ATT
-- CenturyLink
-- Others

[ 
- Describe here how the transit providers responded and why
- How usage was changing (e.g. peak hour, peak traffic, geographic changes
- Describe actions taken (e.g. scaling up, shifting resource, changing routes, traffic policing, etc.
]

## Content Delivery Networks

[ 
- Describe here any observed changes in CDNS
- How usage was changing (e.g. peak hour, peak traffic, geographic changes
- Hit rate on caches before the shutdown and during shutdown
- Describe actions taken (e.g. scaling up, shifting resources) 
]

## Infrastructure
[ Discuss here the observed and reported changes by the network infrastructure - DNS providers, speed test providers 
-  Capture here some of the reports from RIPE
- Discuss changes is measured download and upload speeds
]


## Internet Service Providers
### Wired (Comcast, Charter, Century)
### Wireless (Vistabeam)
### Mobile (ATT, Comcast, Charter)


[ 
- Describe here how the ISPS responded and why
- How usage was changing 
- - peak hour, peak traffic, 
- - geographic changes, 
- - concurrency/household, 
- - cellular offload to wifi
-  Call hold times, hand-off rates (mobile)
- Describe actions taken
- - scaling up, 
- -shifting resource, 
- - adding/changing routes, 
- -adding/changing CDNs, 
- - changing streaming rates
- - providing connectivity (e.g. Keep America Connected Pledge)

]

## Home Networks

[ If possible describe here observations and reports on home network peformance]

## Applications

[ Describe here how the application providers responded
- Temporarily disbabling features such as HD or UHD video?
- Adding more security
- Re-routing through different data centers
- Opening up to make it easier for new users to sign on and use
]

# Observations
[ Discuss here BITAG observations gleaned from the data
-- Traffic went up in access networks, but did not measurably change on the transit networks indicating that the CDN and peering networks were working as designed
-- Impact videoconferencing on the network
--- how much bandwidth videoconferencing really use on the upstream,
--- Traffic ratios (DS:US)- pre-shutdown they were ~20:1 and during the shutdown went down to ~16:1
-- Cooperation across the ecosystem by actors
