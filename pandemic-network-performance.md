#### Scope:

As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, many parts of the world issued stay-at-home orders creating a sudden transition to work-from-home (WFH) and  online instruction for education institutions. This transition created a sudden change in how consumers used the Internet and along with it created a change in network traffic as consumers were now using the Internet in ways they hadn't before. Many consumers were now using new applications such as video conferencing, VPNs, video streaming, and on-line gaming for work, school, and entertainment in ways that they never imagined.  

Officials from all corners of the government (regulators, agencies, legislators) were concerned with how well the network would perform under these new conditions. There were concerns that if the network failed under load that it might lead to panic. In contrast to the U.S., regulators in Europe reached out to large OTT streaming platforms and asked them to reduce the streaming bitrates to reduce the loads on their networks.  

This paper will look at (1) how the network traffic changed, (2) how operators and their networks responded, (3) how networks performed, (4) the QoS (bandwidth, latency, etc.) requirements of the popular applications that were widely used during this time (i.e. Zoom, Webex, streaming, etc.), and (5) how applications were both designed to work under load and how they adapted.  The paper may make recommendations concerning what should be done by all the major stakeholders in the future to ensure the reliability and resiliency of the Internet.

It is important to report on this event and its effects now, while it is still fresh in the memory of people and organizations. Events and issues surrounding COVID-19 will surely be studied for many years, so having an authoritative record pertaining to the performance of the Internet is likely to be helpful and informative.
